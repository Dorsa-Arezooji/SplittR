## Required Libraries
```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(dplyr)
```

## What does it do?

➤ Suppose you have a **large text file** containing a number of **records**, for instance an autogenerated report log where:
* each record starts with a certain character or string (**record identifier**)
* records may have **different numbers of fields**
* records may have **different numbers of lines**.

➤ Now, you need to split this large file into a number of smaller files where:
* all files have the **same number of records**
* all files are **consistent** with the original file in terms of format and text (i.e. no character removed or added)
* the **order** of the records is not changed

**SplittR** DOES THAT!

## How does it work?

1. Browse your local directory to find and upload your text file
2. Type the record identifier, i.e a string or character that each new record starts with, as it appears in your file without any extra quotations
3. Use the slider to choose the number of output splits
4. Click on the Split! button to split the file
5. Once the split is done, you can see the results below - If you receive an error, make sure to enter the record identifier correctly!
6. Use the download button to download a zip file containing your split files!
